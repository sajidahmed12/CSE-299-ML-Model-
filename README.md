Road 360: A machine learning approach to detect roads condition and anomalies.

## Methodology

*Moto: To Detect the roads condition from a picture through image processing.
*Using a machine learning approach: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) or Computer vision: Open CV python. 
*Collecting dataset of at least 10,000 images of Dhaka city and nearby places. (by manually collecting, video framing, Google street view images)
*
The project later will be integrated with a mobile application, where a user can let others know the road condition of any localities and through gps the validation of the image will be detected letting other users/Government representatives know about the condition.
